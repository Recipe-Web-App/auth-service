### 3. GitHub Issues (For Bugs and Features)

Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Recipe-Web-App/auth-service/issues/new/choose) for:

- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Performance issues
- Documentation problems
- Security vulnerabilities (low severity - use Security Advisories for critical)

**Issue Templates:**

- **Bug Report** - Report unexpected behavior
- **Feature Request** - Suggest new functionality
- **Performance Issue** - Report performance problems
- **Documentation** - Documentation improvements
- **Security Vulnerability** - Low-severity security issues

### 4. Security Issues

**IMPORTANT:** For security vulnerabilities, use:

- [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/Recipe-Web-App/auth-service/security/advisories/new) (private)
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details

**Never report security issues publicly through issues or discussions.**

## Common Questions

### Setup and Configuration

**Q: How do I get started?**
A: See the Quick Start section in [README.md](../README.md#quick-start)

**Q: What environment variables are required?**
A: Check [`.env.example`](../.env.example) for all configuration options

**Q: Can I run without PostgreSQL?**
A: Yes, the service gracefully degrades to Redis-only mode. See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#architecture-overview)

**Q: How do I enable TLS/HTTPS?**
A: Set `TLS_CERT_PATH` and `TLS_KEY_PATH` environment variables

### OAuth2 Flows

**Q: Which OAuth2 flows are supported?**
A: Authorization Code Flow with PKCE and Client Credentials Flow. See [README.md](../README.md#features)

**Q: Is PKCE required?**
A: Yes, PKCE is enforced for Authorization Code Flow for security

**Q: How do I register a client?**
A: See the Client Management section in [README.md](../README.md)

**Q: What token lifetime should I use?**
A: Recommended: 15 minutes for access tokens, 7 days for refresh tokens

### Troubleshooting

**Q: Service fails to start?**

- Check logs: `docker logs <container-name>`
- Verify environment variables
- Check PostgreSQL/Redis connectivity
- Review [README.md](../README.md#troubleshooting) troubleshooting section

**Q: Tokens are not validating?**

- Verify JWT signing key matches between instances
- Check token expiration
- Ensure algorithm configuration is correct
- Review logs for validation errors

**Q: Performance issues?**

- Check database connection pool settings
- Verify Redis is accessible
- Review rate limiting configuration
- See [Performance Issue Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/performance_issue.yml)

**Q: CORS errors?**

- Configure `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable
- Check request Origin header
- Review middleware configuration

### Development

**Q: How do I contribute?**
A: See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for complete guidelines

**Q: How do I run tests?**
A: Run `make test` or see [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#testing) for test commands

**Q: What's the code structure?**
A: See Architecture Overview in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#architecture-overview)

## Community Guidelines

When asking for help:

- **Be specific** - Include exact error messages, versions, configurations
- **Provide context** - What were you trying to do? What happened instead?
- **Include details** - Environment, deployment method, relevant logs
- **Be patient** - Maintainers and community volunteers help in their free time

## Bug Report Best Practices

When reporting bugs, include:

- Go version
- Deployment environment (Docker/K8s/Local)
- Exact error messages
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant configuration (redact secrets!)
- Logs (redact sensitive info!)
