# Beads Workflow Context

> **Context Recovery**: Run `bd prime` after compaction, clear, or new session
> Hooks auto-call this in Claude Code when .beads/ detected

# 🚨 SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL 🚨

**CRITICAL**: Before saying "done" or "complete", you MUST run this checklist:

```
[ ] 1. git status              (check what changed)
[ ] 2. git add <files>         (stage code changes)
[ ] 3. bd sync                 (commit beads changes)
[ ] 4. git commit -m "..."     (commit code)
[ ] 5. bd sync                 (commit any new beads changes)
[ ] 6. git push                (push to remote)
```

**NEVER skip this.** Work is not done until pushed.

## Core Rules

- Track strategic work in beads (multi-session, dependencies, discovered work)
- Use `bd create` for issues, TodoWrite for simple single-session execution
- When in doubt, prefer bd—persistence you don't need beats lost context
- Git workflow: hooks auto-sync, run `bd sync` at session end
- Session management: check `bd ready` for available work

## Essential Commands

### Finding Work

- `bd ready` - Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
- `bd list --status=open` - All open issues
- `bd list --status=in_progress` - Your active work
- `bd show <id>` - Detailed issue view with dependencies

### Creating & Updating

- `bd create --title="..." --type=task|bug|feature --priority=2` - New issue
  - Priority: 0-4 or P0-P4 (0=critical, 2=medium, 4=backlog). NOT "high"/"medium"/"low"
- `bd update <id> --status=in_progress` - Claim work
- `bd update <id> --assignee=username` - Assign to someone
- `bd update <id> --title/--description/--notes/--design` - Update fields inline
- `bd close <id>` - Mark complete
- `bd close <id1> <id2> ...` - Close multiple issues at once (more efficient)
- `bd close <id> --reason="explanation"` - Close with reason
- **Tip**: When creating multiple issues/tasks/epics, use parallel subagents for efficiency
- **WARNING**: Do NOT use `bd edit` - it opens $EDITOR (vim/nano) which blocks agents

### Dependencies & Blocking

- `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` - Add dependency (issue depends on depends-on)
- `bd blocked` - Show all blocked issues
- `bd show <id>` - See what's blocking/blocked by this issue

### Sync & Collaboration

- `bd sync` - Sync with git remote (run at session end)
- `bd sync --status` - Check sync status without syncing

### Project Health

- `bd stats` - Project statistics (open/closed/blocked counts)
- `bd doctor` - Check for issues (sync problems, missing hooks)

## Common Workflows

**Starting work:**

```bash
bd ready           # Find available work
bd show <id>       # Review issue details
bd update <id> --status=in_progress  # Claim it
```

**Completing work:**

```bash
bd close <id1> <id2> ...    # Close all completed issues at once
bd sync                     # Push to remote
```

**Creating dependent work:**

```bash
# Run bd create commands in parallel (use subagents for many items)
bd create --title="Implement feature X" --type=feature
bd create --title="Write tests for X" --type=task
bd dep add beads-yyy beads-xxx  # Tests depend on Feature (Feature blocks tests)
```

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" --description="Details about what was found" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs with git:

- Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)
- Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)
- No manual export/import needed!

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
